# MediaTracker

Application developed for the course "Design and Implementation of Mobile Applications" by Luciano Baresi at Politecnico di Milano, Computer Science and Engineering, 2015/2016.

### Description
MediaTracker is an Android mobile application that allows to keep track of books, movies, TV shows and videogames. It allows to add media items (possibly retrieving their data automatically from the internet) and to view their lists (tracked media items and completed media items). It also allows to receive random suggestions from the lists and to be notified when upcoming media items become available.
